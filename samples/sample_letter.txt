Pertinent Results:
CT head on admit:

IMPRESSION:
1. Large left parieto-occipital intraparenchymal hematoma with
subdural and subarachnoid hemorrhage as described above.
2. Approximately 1 cm subfalcine herniation appears to be
unchanged since the prior study; however, direct comparison is
limited in the absence of outside hospital study scanned into
PACS at the time of this dictation.

NOTE ADDED AT ATTENDING REVIEW: I agree with the interpretation
of the [**Hospital1 18**] study. However, the outside images are not
available for review at this time, so I cannot determine whether
there have been changes in the interval. The study and the
report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

CTA:
IMPRESSION:
1. Large left parieto-occipital hemorrhage with surrounding
edema. While
this appearance is not definitive, likely etiologies include a
hemorrhagic
infarct. Less likely consideration would be amyloid angiopathy.
2. Small left subdural hematoma with associated right shift of
normal midline structures.
3. Unremarkable post-contrast angiogram images with no evidence
of arterial or venous filling defects.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr [**Known lastname 7143**] was admitted to the TSICU was started on Mannitol and
his BP<140. He began to localize his left arm and withdraw his
legs. His respiratory status improved and family made the
decision to have him extubated and chaged his Code status to
DNR/DNI.

He presented with hyponatremia and was undergoing ongoing
replacement therapy. He also had a CTA performed that was
negative for possible aneurysm or AVM as the source of the
bleed.

Given patient's pre-hospital status and level of functioning and
previously expressed desires for care, after a family meeting
with the neurosurgery and neurology service the family decided
to not esculate care and continue with supportive care only.
